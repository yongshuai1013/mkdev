## Why mkdev

- **Real certs in your system trust store.** No browser warnings, no `--insecure`, no per-project root.
- **No per-app config.** One TOML, one bbolt file. Your app stays untouched.
- **Single static Go binary.** No Node, no Docker, no nginx.conf to copy-paste.
- **No background daemon yet.** Plan 2 will add that; today `serve` runs in the foreground.

## What it does

```
mkdev install                    # generates CA, trusts in system store
mkdev add myapp localhost:3000   # routes https://myapp.local → localhost:3000
mkdev serve                      # foreground TLS proxy
curl https://myapp.local           # 200 from your local app
```

That's the whole pitch. Four lines, real HTTPS.

## Install

No prebuilt binaries yet. Build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/venkatkrishna07/mkdev.git
cd mkdev
make build
cp bin/mkdev ~/bin/        # or /usr/local/bin
```

Requires **Go 1.25+**.

## Platform support

| Platform | Trust store                                                       | Elevation       |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| macOS    | System Keychain (`security add-trusted-cert`)                     | `sudo` / `osascript` |
| Linux    | `update-ca-trust` / `update-ca-certificates` / `trust extract-compat` | `sudo` / `pkexec` |
| Windows  | `ROOT` system store via `crypt32.dll`                             | UAC (PowerShell `RunAs`) |

Linux distros detected: Debian/Ubuntu (`/usr/local/share/ca-certificates`), RHEL/Fedora (`/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors`), Arch (`/etc/ca-certificates/trust-source/anchors`), openSUSE (`/usr/share/pki/trust/anchors`).

Firefox uses its own NSS store and is **not yet covered** — system Chrome/Safari/Edge/curl/wget all work.

## Commands

| Command                  | Purpose                                                       |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `install`                | Generate the root CA, write defaults, trust in system store.  |
| `add <name> <target>`    | Add route. Appends a `127.0.0.1` entry to `/etc/hosts`.       |
| `remove <name>`          | Remove route and its `/etc/hosts` entry.                      |
| `list`                   | List routes in the store.                                     |
| `serve`                  | Run the TLS reverse proxy in the foreground.                  |
| `uninstall`              | Untrust the CA. `--purge` also wipes `~/.mkdev/`.             |
| `hosts-helper`           | Hidden. Invoked via `sudo` to mutate `/etc/hosts` atomically. |

### Target formats

`<target>` accepts any of:

```
host:port                  e.g. localhost:3000
http://host[:port]/path    e.g. http://localhost:3000/api
https://host[:port]/path   e.g. https://gitlab.example.com
```

For HTTPS upstreams (e.g., a private GitLab on a corporate VPN) the upstream's TLS cert must verify against the system trust store. Private CAs need their root added to the OS keychain.

`hosts-helper` is not meant to be called directly. `add` / `remove` re-invoke the same binary under `sudo` to perform the privileged `/etc/hosts` write.

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.mkdev/config.toml`. Defaults:

```toml
tld           = ".local"   # appended to bare names in `add`
proxy_port    = 443        # binding :443 requires sudo on serve
theme         = "auto"     # reserved for future TUI
log_retention = "7d"       # reserved
log_max_size  = "100MB"    # reserved
```

| Field           | Default     | Notes                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `tld`           | `.local`    | Auto-appended when `add <name>` has no dot.                 |
| `proxy_port`    | `443`       | Set to `8443` to run `serve` without sudo for dev testing.  |
| `theme`         | `auto`      | Reserved for the upcoming TUI.                              |
| `log_retention` | `7d`        | Reserved.                                                   |
| `log_max_size`  | `100MB`     | Reserved.                                                   |

Override the config directory with `--home <path>` or `MKDEV_HOME=...`.

## How it works

- Generates an **ECDSA P-256** root CA at `~/.mkdev/ca/`. The private key is mode `0o400`.
- Installs the CA in the OS-native trust store: macOS Keychain (`security`), Linux CA-bundle directory + `update-ca-*`, Windows `ROOT` store via `crypt32.dll`. Trust-store integration is adapted from [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) (BSD-3) — see [`LICENSE-MKCERT`](./LICENSE-MKCERT).
- On `add`, writes a route to a **bbolt** KV at `~/.mkdev/state.db` and appends a `127.0.0.1 <name>.<tld>` line to `/etc/hosts` via a `sudo`-invoked helper subcommand.
- `serve` listens TLS on `0.0.0.0:<proxy_port>`, **mints leaf certs per SNI** on demand using the root CA, and reverse-proxies to the configured upstream.
- The route table is re-read every 2 seconds, so `add` / `remove` take effect without restarting `serve`.
- The proxy binds `0.0.0.0`, but non-loopback requests are 403'd unless the matching route is marked **shared** — see [Share over LAN](#share-over-lan-experimental).

## Security

This tool installs a **private CA into your system trust store**. Anyone with read access to `~/.mkdev/ca/rootCA-key.pem` can mint TLS certs that your machine will trust. The key is created `0o400` (owner read only).

- The proxy binds `0.0.0.0`, but a connection-source ACL 403s LAN requests to any route not explicitly marked **shared**. Loopback always passes.
- No telemetry. No remote calls. No update checks.
- `add` / `remove` invoke `sudo` to mutate `/etc/hosts`. See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for the threat model and a known limit around `os.Executable()`-resolved helper paths.

## Uninstall

```sh
mkdev uninstall           # untrust CA, remove /etc/hosts entries
mkdev uninstall --purge   # also delete ~/.mkdev/
```

If something gets stuck, open **Keychain Access.app**, search for `mkdev`, and delete by hand. Then `grep mkdev /etc/hosts` and clean any leftovers.

## Comparisons

- **vs. [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert):** mkcert does one thing — issuing locally-trusted certs — and does it very well. mkdev also does that, plus `/etc/hosts` and the reverse proxy. If all you want is certs, use mkcert.
- **vs. [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com):** Caddy is a production-grade reverse proxy. You write a `Caddyfile` per project. mkdev is opinionated: one binary, four commands, no config per project.
- **vs. dnsmasq + nginx:** the classic stack. Powerful, configurable, and a half-day of YAML and `brew services`. mkdev trades flexibility for the 4-line quickstart.

mkdev is the **"all three jobs (cert, hosts, proxy) in one binary"** play.

## Roadmap

Internal design docs and phased plans live under [`docs/superpowers/specs/`](./docs/superpowers/specs/) and [`docs/superpowers/plans/`](./docs/superpowers/plans/). They are intentionally not gitignored — useful as context.

Planned, in order:

- **Plan 2** — background daemon with gRPC IPC; `serve` becomes `up`/`down`.
- **Plan 3-4** — TUI (route table, live logs, cert inspection).
- ~~**Plan 5** — Linux and Windows trust-store support.~~ ✅ Shipped.
- **Plan 6** — signed releases via goreleaser, CI matrix, Homebrew tap.

Nothing on the roadmap is implemented yet. If a feature isn't in the table above, it doesn't exist.

## Share over LAN (experimental)

Mark individual routes as shared:

1. In the TUI Domains tab, select a route and press `s` to flip the **SHARE** column to `LAN`.
2. The shared route is advertised via mDNS as `<name>.local` → this machine's LAN IP. Other devices on the same Wi-Fi can resolve it.

Devices on the LAN must trust the mkdev CA to connect without warnings. Copy `~/.mkdev/ca/rootCA.pem` to each device:

- **macOS**: open in Keychain → System → Always Trust.
- **iOS**: AirDrop → Settings → Profile Downloaded → install → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings → enable.
- **Windows**: `certutil -addstore -f Root rootCA.pem` (admin).
- **Android**: Settings → Security → Install a certificate → CA certificate.

### Caveats

- Only `.local` routes are advertised. Other TLDs are still served by the proxy but unreachable by name from the LAN.
- Multicast is often blocked on corporate / cloud networks. Home/office Wi-Fi works.
- Toggling `s` is live — both mDNS advertising and LAN-side access change immediately on the next request. No restart needed.
- The proxy always binds `0.0.0.0` so LAN clients can connect when a route is shared. Non-shared routes are 403'd for non-loopback requests as defense-in-depth.
- Anyone on the LAN can hit your dev servers when a route is shared. Don't enable on untrusted Wi-Fi.
